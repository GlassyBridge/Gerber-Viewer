# Gerber Viewer (WIP)
A simple web app to view your gerbers. (Part one of my big project)
## How to use
- Load Gerber files using the file input at the bottom left corner. (.gbrjob files aren't supported so dont upload them.)
- Use mouse wheel to zoom in and out, click and drag to pan the view. (touch is kindof supported but wouldn't recommend mobile devices to demo this project)
- Use the buttons at the top center to switch between top, bottom and layers view.
- Use the controls at the bottom center to zoom in, zoom out and reset the view.
- In layers view only: Use the layers panel at the right side to toggle visibility of individual layers.
## Upcoming features
- 3d view for gerbers
- Ability to add 3d models for components.
- Permanent shareable links.
- Possibly a redisign of the website.
